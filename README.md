BMI Calculator

Description:
Create a web-based Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator where users can enter their height and
weight to check their BMI category.

Technologies:
Python, HTML, CSS

Steps:
Frontend (HTML & CSS):
Design a form to input height (cm) and weight (kg), and display the BMI result with color
indicators for different categories.

Backend (Python):
Write Python logic in Flask to calculate BMI and display categories such as Underweight,
Normal, Overweight, or Obese. (Output: Display the value and Category)

Hint:
If BMI < 18.5 → Category: Underweight
If 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9 → Category: Normal
If 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9 → Category: Overweight
If BMI ≥ 30 → Category: Obese
